## Background Information

Me and my group member(Chin and Ulysses) were working on our freedom project Mvp. Since we had a rough start in the begining, we have a bit of a late start. However That doesn't mean we can't recover. 

## Mvp Progress (My Pov)

### The Begining

We want to start by the basic:the player, movemnet, and the map.

Chin has create main using Tiled which cap out fine, however when Chin try to implement in to code it does not work. So he reach out to Ulysses and me. I say ok I will try to work on the the may while your work on the movment for now.

After some tinkering and try out how to figure out how to put in the map.Json, I couldn't get it to work as well. 

### Player animation

So I notify Chin, then decide to work on the player animation instead. I look for sprite and came across and site that have gallery of differnt things you can download. The site is call https://itch.io/io and the sprite I got from https://penzilla.itch.io/hooded-protagonist.
