# Entry 4
##### 3/17/23

## context
We are working on the MVp and continuing to learn our tool. Our tool is phaser.This is the fouth week and so far we are not doing so good.

## progress
I had spend the week trying to learn more of my tool and trying to figure out how to get the code to work but for the latter I had been having trouble.  

On learning my tool I just follow the tutorial and see what syntax/code do what what purpose and only when I understant what it does I move onto the next part. The tutproa; I am using is
 https://gamedevacademy.org/how-to-create-a-turn-based-rpg-game-in-phaser-3-part-1/ and https://gamedevacademy.org/how-to-create-a-turn-based-rpg-game-in-phaser-3-part-2/. If I don't understand it, I will make a copy of the code and tinker with it till I uderstand what is going on.
```js
        // shake the world
        // this.cameras.main.shake(50);

        // change the effect to flash or fade.
        //fade
        // this.cameras.main.once('camerafadeincomplete', function (camera) {
        //     camera.fadeOut(3000);
        // });
        // this.cameras.main.fadeIn(3000);

        //flash
        // this.input.on('pointerdown', function () {
        //     this.cameras.main.flash();
        // }, this);

```
For my MVP, I been having trouble as I had not figure out why doest the code not show up and how to solve the error that keep coming up.

## challenges
Not only the proublem I had stated ontop, Our group have not done as much As we would want to as we have differnt schedule, and it is hard to find thr right time to meet together and work on the MVP.
