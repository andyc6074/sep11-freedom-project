 # Entry 6
##### 5/26/23

## Context
After we are done making the year-long project, we can now present it to our class, As well as to the rest of the school in the form of a elevator pitch. 
## Process
I took a template from an online site called "https://slidesgo.com/theme/retro-video-games-newsletter#search-game&position-8&results-288&rs=search". Then I separated the template, and created the slide page I needed for the presentation. I soon finsh the base design and project info/ I then called my partner to help think of a hook and fix anything we need for the slide. I soon later made a hook, and Chin and Uylsse both filled in their part of challenges and takeaways. Me and Chin then worked together to create the Gif and later I just finished the remaining detail and info.
## Takeaways
My takeaway is to practice more if you are not sure if you are ready for the presentation. I learn to practice reading the lines over and over again till I feel like I am ready enough.
### In-class presentation 
The takeaway I have specifically for the In-class is to communicate with your partner in the making of the slide because it will help out with organizing the actual presentation.
### Expo elevator pitch 
As for the Expo, you don't have to explain everything, you just have to get their attraction and make it short and sweet.

## Skills
I had not only learned the takeaway above, but I had also improved my ability to speak and make eye contact in front of large groups and under pressure.

I also improved my skill to not only follow the script but also to adapt to what is happening around me.
