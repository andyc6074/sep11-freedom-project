I chose Melon.js because it is the next one on my list that seem interesting to me. I fisrt try to tinker with Impact.js but it dirnt realy work that well, Impact.js seem to be quite outdated as the last update seem to be around 2014-2016 however that is were I turn to Mellon.js, is in also a java script game engine which not only seem to be more popular it is geting update. 

The the solfware me and my parther am going to make with javascript is a RPG game(howver we not not fully sure if the type of game is going to stay the same as an RPG might be too much. However I stil would like to try to take on the challenge to make it happen.)

Now with the background out of the way.

What I did for impact is trying to make the game but it diid not work so well as things add up, so today I spend some time trying melon.js . while there is some thing I dont fully understand lock my intrest on learning mellon.js. I try modifying the game/texture like they told me too and it was quite fun but I still need to learn how to make the game from scratch.
