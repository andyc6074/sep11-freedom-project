### Background
I chose phaser because it is the next one on my list that seem interesting to me. I fisrt try to tinker with Impact.js but it dirnt realy work that well, Impact.js seem to be quite outdated as the last update seem to be around 2014-2016 however that is were I turn to Mellon.js, which seem great at first but I ran into some issue. SO I decide to use phaser.js. Note only that It seem have better range of tool work with.

The the solfware me and my parther am going to make with javascript is a RPG game(howver we not not fully sure if the type of game is going to stay the same as an RPG might be too much. However I stil would like to try to take on the challenge to make it happen.)

Now with the background out of the way.

### Blog 1
What I did for impact is trying to make the game but it diid not work so well as things add up, so today I spend some time trying melon.js . I  try modifying the game/texture like they told me too and it was quite fun however it does not work that great as the tool it use seem to look for the file in my computher which is not as it is in the ide. This cause some unessary issue to occur. So I decide to try phaser and it seem to be workking so far. Shince I dont have much time to tiker with phaser that ,uc I don't have a full idea on it however by doing so research so people sugest phaser over melon.js and they say phaser.js is more beginner friendly.
